    # Libraries have been installed in:
    #    /usr/local/lib
    #
    # If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
    # in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
    # specify the full pathname of the library, or use the `-LLIBDIR'
    # flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
    #    - add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
    #      during execution
    #    - add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
    #      during linking
    #    - use the `-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
    #    - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'
    #
    # See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
    # more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.
